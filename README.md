# project_newsTxtClassification

#### Introduction

This project involves a news text classification task, utilizing machine learning algorithms such as TF-IDF, as well as deep learning approaches like word2vec combined with RNN. The subsequent BERT algorithm is yet to be incorporated.

#### Architecture
1. CountVectorizer + RidgeClassifier
2. TF-IDF + RidgeClassifier
3. RidgeClassifier model save
4. embedding + Classifier（lstm,bert,RidgeClassifier）
5. solve problems
