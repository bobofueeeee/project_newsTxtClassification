#### Introduction

For the news text classification task, we employed machine learning algorithms such as CountVectorizer combined with RidgeClassifier, and TF-IDF combined with RidgeClassifier. We also utilized deep learning algorithms including word2vec integrated with LSTM, and BERT. Additionally, we discussed how to store the models, how to vectorize the models (or more accurately, how to vectorize the input data for the models), the challenges encountered during the process, and the corresponding solutions.

#### Architecture
1. CountVectorizer + RidgeClassifier
2. TF-IDF + RidgeClassifier
3. RidgeClassifier model save
4. embedding + Classifier（lstm,bert,RidgeClassifier）
5. solve problems
